# Chart-Derendering
In this repository, we develop a model for derendering images into tables. EfficientNet is used to classify the chart in the given image. MatCha, a Visual Question Answering subset of the Pix2Struct architecture is used to derender the classified image and find the x and y co-ordinates of the data points in the chart.
